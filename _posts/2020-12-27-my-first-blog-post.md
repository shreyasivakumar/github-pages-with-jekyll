First up we have soccer!! I have played soccer since the age of 7 until now (I'm 16), meaning I've been playing for 9 years!
I have made the majority of my longest friendships through this sport. 
I love everything about the sport, but some of my favorite things about it are teamwork, the fun game in general, and the jokes we crack off the pitch.
